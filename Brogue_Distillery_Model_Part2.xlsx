// 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
// Source: uploaded_file_The_Brogue_Distillery_American_Single_Malts_Moment_in_Context__6__pdf.txt
Business Overview:,"The Brogue Distillery, led by renowned distiller Jake Holshue, is acquiring the assets of the former Rogue distillery to launch a new American Single Malt Whisky (ASMW) brand. The acquisition includes 1,358 barrels of aged ASMW, distillery equipment, and a fully permitted DSP location at the Port of Newport."
Market Opportunity:,"With ASMW becoming an official TTB category in Jan 2025, America is positioned to challenge Scotland's single malt dominance. The Brogue Distillery aims to own the smoke-forward, ""Islay-style"" lane in the U.S. market, leveraging a first-to-market advantage with aged inventory that is impossible to replicate quickly."
Financial Highlights (Year 1):,"Projected Revenue of " & TEXT('Cashflow & Runway'!N2, "$#,##0,") & " and EBITDA of " & TEXT('Cashflow & Runway'!N11, "$#,##0,") & ". The business is projected to be cash-flow breakeven in month " & 'Cashflow & Runway'!N53 & ". The downside is fully asset-backed by barrel and equipment resale value."
Use of Funds:,"The " & TEXT('Cap Table + SAFE Conversion'!B5, "$#,##0,") & " SAFE round will be used to fund the acquisition of mature inventory at liquidation pricing (~$11/proof gal), cover initial operating expenses, and ramp up marketing and distribution for the new Brogue brand."
Risk Mitigants:,"- **Inventory Risk:** Aged inventory acquired at fire-sale pricing, providing an immediate path to revenue.
- **Market Risk:** ASMW category has a strong tailwind with new official designation. Jake Holshue's reputation provides significant credibility.
- **Operational Risk:** Turnkey facility and experienced team minimize operational startup challenges.
- **Financial Risk:** Downside is asset-backed; even a forced liquidation is projected to cover initial investment."

// 3. APPENDIX
Detailed Assumptions:,"All assumptions are detailed in the 'Assumptions' tab. Key drivers include a Year 1 target of " & 'Assumptions'!B4 & " bottles, an average wholesale price of " & TEXT('Assumptions'!B15, "$0.00") & ", and a raw spirit cost of " & TEXT('Assumptions'!B21, "$0.00") & " per proof gallon."
Regulatory Roadmap:,"The Brogue Distillery will operate under its existing DSP location at the Port of Newport. All necessary TTB and OLCC filings are in place. The recent TTB ruling on ASMW (Jan 19, 2025) provides a clear regulatory framework for our core product category."
Management Team:,"Led by Jake Holshue, a two-time elected chair of the American Craft Spirits Association (ACSA) and a key lobbyist for the official ASMW category designation. Jake personally distilled the 1,358 barrels of whisky being acquired, ensuring unparalleled product knowledge and quality control."
Exit Strategy:,"The company will be positioned for a strategic acquisition by a major spirits portfolio (e.g., Diageo, Pernod Ricard, Beam Suntory) seeking a credible, high-growth entry into the premium American Single Malt category. The target exit timeline is 3-5 years post-Series A funding."

// NOTE ON MODEL BEST PRACTICES
// Named Ranges: All key inputs on the 'Assumptions' tab should be converted to Named Ranges (e.g., 'Volume_Y1', 'Capex_Overrun_Pct') for formula clarity.
// Protection: All sheets should be protected, with only the blue input cells on the 'Assumptions' and 'Scenario Switcher' tabs left unlocked. This prevents accidental formula deletion.
// Conditional Formatting: Use on the P&L and Cash Flow statements to highlight negative numbers (red text) and on the 'Dashboards' to create visual alerts (e.g., runway gauge colors).
// Version Control: The filename should include a version number (e.g., v1.0). A 'Changelog' tab can be added to track modifications.
